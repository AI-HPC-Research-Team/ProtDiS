# ProtDiS: Protein Disentangled Structure Representation

**ProtDiS** is a framework for learning *knowledge-guided, disentangled structural representations* of protein micro-environments.  
Instead of embedding protein structures into opaque high-dimensional vectors, ProtDiS decomposes each local environment into **biophysically meaningful channels**—such as solvent exposure, packing density, curvature, flexibility, and stability—forming a human-understandable latent space that can be inspected, edited, and applied across tasks.

## 🧠 Overview

ProtDiS enables a new form of **knowledge-aligned structural representation learning**, supporting:

### ✔ Knowledge-aligned structural analysis  
Decomposed knowledge channels (e.g., solvent exposure, packing density, curvature, flexibility, stability) allow structural variation to be examined along biological axes rather than black-box latent components.

### ✔ Fine-grained functional discrimination among similar folds  
Even when two proteins share nearly identical global folds (high TM-score), ProtDiS reveals micro-environment differences that correspond to functional divergence (e.g., enzyme subclasses, binding preferences).

### ✔ Improved performance on downstream structure–function tasks  
ProtDiS selectively fuses **task-relevant knowledge channels**, improving generalization, especially under structure-based data splits.

### ✔ (In Progress) Interpretable feature manipulation for modeling and design  
Biophysical dimensions will serve as directions for controlled edits to protein latent space.

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

We recommend using a virtual environment or Conda.

```bash
conda create -n protein_env python=3.9
conda activate protein_env
```

Dependencies include:

- `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`
- `biopython`
- `torch`
- `tqdm`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`


## 📦 Data Preparation

The model takes protein structural data as input (e.g., PDB/CIF files). Each protein is decomposed into local knowledge embeddings.

### Step 1: Download Protein Structures

You can download original structures from the PDB/AlphafoldDB or use datasets like SCOPe or CATH.

### Step 2: Preprocess Structures

The data preprocessing scripts will be made available in the future.


## 🏋️‍♂️ Training

To train the Knowledge Orthogonal Network:

```bash
cd ProtDiS
python train.py -C src/configs/config_kon_all.yaml
```

## ✅ Validation & Downstream Tasks

You can validate the learned representations on tasks such as:

### 1. Enzyme classification

```bash
cd ProtDis/tasks/proteinshake
python tasks/train.py -C src/configs/ec/cdconv_structure.yaml
```

### 2. Protein-ligand binding site

```bash
cd ProtDis/tasks/proteinshake
python tasks/train.py -C src/configs/binding_site/cdconv_structure.yaml
```
